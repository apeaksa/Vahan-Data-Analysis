# Vahan-Data-Analysis
Vahan serves as a comprehensive data repository for all registered vehicles in India, while Sarathi contains computerized data on driving licenses across the country. These applications are designed, maintained, and supported by the National Informatics Centre. The Vahan website and application provide access to a vast amount of vehicle data, with over 285 million digitized vehicle records as of March 12, 2020. Manual data collection and analysis are conducted to gain insights and improve decision-making. The data preprocessing and analysis involve organizing unstructured data into a structured format for further analysis, such as using spreadsheets or statistical software. The primary objective of the analysis was to identify trends in vehicle registrations across different Regional Transport Offices (RTOs), considering the seasonal components and assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on registrations. Time series forecasting techniques, including ARIMA and SARIMA models, were employed to predict the effects of the pandemic and analyze the bounce-back of RTOs. The analysis also involved visualizations using Power BI, Tableau, and Python to provide clear and actionable insights from the data.
